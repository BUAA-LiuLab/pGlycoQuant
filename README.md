# pGlycoQuant Description



#### Here, we report pGlycoQuant, a generic software tool for quantitative intact glycopeptide analysis, supporting both primary and tandem mass spectrometry quantitation for multiple quantitative strategies. pGlycoQuant advances in glycopeptide evidence matching through applying a deep learning model that reduces missing values for glycopeptide quantification by over 60% compared with Byologic, MSFragger-Glyco and Skyline, as well as an optional function of Match-In-Run (MIR) algorithm for more quantitative coverage of glycopeptides, thus greatly expanding the quantitative function of several powerful search engines, currently including pGlyco 2.0, pGlyco3, Byonic and MSFragger-Glyco.
